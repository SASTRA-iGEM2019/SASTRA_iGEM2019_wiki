           It was a bustling Monday morning on the Chennai roads. The venue for the grand SynBio Auction was getting ready at a fervent pace. Tumultuous atmosphere prevailed with the setting up of the chairs, tables, desks and scorecards for the auction.  Avid participants of the auction were all geared up and were intensely discussing with their team members to strategize and win. We, the members of the iGEM SASTRA Team had spent a week’s time crafting the SynBio auction with love for the fraternity of D. A. V. Public School, Velachery. The target audience for the session was the 12th-grade students of Biology and Computer Science streams, who were accompanied by their subject teachers.

           The iGEM SASTRA team in their second outing, conducted the human practices session for the students of class XI and XII at Shri Natesan Vidyasala, Mannivakkam on 20th June 2019. The activity developed for the school students was a grand Synthetic Biology auction, colloquially called the SynBio Auction. The session witnessed the participation of over 200 enthusiastic school students pursuing education in Science streams. An introductory presentation on Synthetic Biology and our current project had the audience engaged. Then, the grand SynBio auction began. The students were divided into 5 teams, led by a teacher for participation in the auction. The phases saw heated bidding for each of the components. The auction went on for nearly an hour and we were surprised to see the participating students maintain a fervent atmosphere throughout. The final stage of the activity involved the teams to consolidate their strategies and justify their choice of components purchased in the course of the auction. Subsequently, the teams were asked to send a member from their team to the center stage to present their solution to the judges within a minute. The curtains finally fell on the second human practice session of our iGEM team with a group photo of the staff, students and the iGEM SASTRA team.

           Our third human practices session was held at Chettinad Vidyashram, Chennai on 21st June 2019. The session was conducted in collaboration with IIT (Indian Institute of Technology) Madras iGEM team. The session witnessed the participation of 250 enthusiastic class XI and XII students from the biology and biotechnology streams, lasting just over 2 hours. We had three separate sessions addressing the different aspects of Synthetic Biology and also made sure that the content was put across in a simplified way for the students to understand. A few cool iGEM project examples were also discussed and these included projects about mimicking the smell of rain in the lab and playing minesweeper with E.coli. This was followed by the members of the IIT Madras team talking about their iGEM project and a small card game called Micropolis. The curtains finally fell on the third human practices session of our team with a group photo along with the IIT Madras iGEM team members.

           We got an opportunity to interact with victims of domestic violence and burns under the PCVC Organization. The meet was aimed to create awareness about cervical cancer and the Pap smear test. PCVC is an NGO that provides help to women who have been victims of domestic violence and burn accidents. There were about 45 women present for the sessions held at both branches of the NGO. We informed them about the consent form and also about their right to stop participating in this procedure at any point of time without any consequences. We elaborated on cervical cancer, its symptoms and causes, available diagnosis methods, available treatments and preventive measures. We explained to them about the Pap smear test, its uses, the way it is performed through a video, its significance and briefed them extensively on why it is considered to be a social taboo in India. Many women in the group showed keen interest to the talk and some even clarified their doubts about it. We had a questionnaire prepared to evaluate the awareness that women have about cervical cancer and the Pap smear test, predominantly. The questions that followed were about their opinions on them. From the data we collected from the questionnaire, we came to a conclusion that most of them did not know about cervical cancer and the invasive Pap smear test, prior to our session. With the outcome of our session, they promised us that they would take care of themselves and their close ones by informing them about it.

           It was an effulgent day in Trichy. Having travelled in the bus from the college in Tirumalaisamudram to Tiruchirapalli in the scorching heat, all of us were happy to see eager faces waiting to listen to us. We addressed a total of 23 women in two sessions. We introduced ourselves and started the session with the question ‘What is cervical cancer?’. The session was addressed in Tamil as the women were from rural areas surrounding Tiruchirapalli. Few women asserted that they had heard of the term in news channels but were not sure what it was. We tried to explain a few technical terms in colloquial terms for a better understanding of the topic. We then elucidated the need for diagnosis of cervical cancer, the symptoms and then about the Pap smear test. We also briefed them about the way the test is performed and how it might be uncomfortable and invasive. At this point, all of them were aware of the topic and had a few questions that were answered by us. After which we told them about our project - an alternative and minimally invasive procedure instead of the Pap smear test. Many of the women present there had a few tales to tell about their encounters with cancer. This enabled us to look at cervical cancer from a different perspective. Lastly, we helped them to fill out our survey. All of them were very responsive and gave us a lot of suggestions. Through this survey, we managed to educate women about cervical cancer, its symptoms and make a comparison on the available diagnostic methods to find the appropriate one for early diagnosis. Moreover, we also realised that the target audience opined that an alternative paper based diagnostic tool would be preferred to the existing Pap smear test.

           We met Dr. M.A. Raja, Medical Oncologist to get resourceful information about cervical cancer, which was essential to define the motivation of our project cogently. We briefed him about iGEM and our project. Dr. Raja opined that, clinically it is difficult to entirely change the high success rate associated with already existing diagnostic methods with disruptive technologies. He then told us about the existing methods of diagnosis for cervical cancer which included Pap smear test and liquid based test. The doctor reckoned that the only difficulty which cervical cancer patients would face is to visit a male doctor. Otherwise, he felt that patients are not experiencing much discomfort. Also, he mentioned that cervical cancer is the only cancer type in which precancerous studies are possible using which the cancer could be prevented even before it progresses. He added that most of the women are unaware of cervical cancer which makes it a “poor women disease” making it mostly prevalent in rural areas. He also informed us about the progression of cervical cancer, the treatment methods. He spoke about the possibility of extending this form of early stage cancer detection to other forms of cancer like breast cancer where people feel that the existing mammogram method is a bit uncomfortable. Also, he mentioned that the numbers of cases of cervical cancer are much less compared to other cancer types like breast cancer in Apollo. He also added that in government hospitals, Pap smear tests are done for free and it is part of a master health check-up in many private hospitals. When questioned about the difficulties faced by a lab technician while screening for cervical cancer, Dr. Raja mentioned that the only problem would be the inadequacy of sample. Dr. Raja finally concluded saying that our sensor must be applicable more than feasible and he appreciated our concept and asked us to look into its applications in other forms of cancer also.

           Rainy mornings and cloudy skies. A perfect day to chill at home, but that was not the plan for SASTRA’s iGEM team. We had an appointment with Dr. J. S. Malliga, the head-in charge of Preventive Oncology department of Cancer Institute (WIA) Adyar. The discussion started off with the burden of cervical cancer in the population and how it was highly prevalent and morbid in the population till the last decade until it was taken over by breast cancer in India, especially Tamil Nadu. Cervical cancer, in her words, remains as a prevalent disease in 18/32 districts of Tamil Nadu. Tamil Nadu has an extensive and exhaustive population-based statistical database on cervical cancer, which is one of the largest in the world. She also gave us possible reasons for getting affected with cervical cancer. Post the discussion on the burden of cervical cancer, Dr. Malliga shifted gears to discuss how HPV was the sole cause for the same, followed by discussions on conventional preventive techniques and screening techniques for cervical cancer. She also briefed us about the different screening techniques and their sensitivity. She then went on to explain the disease pathophysiology. She also updated us on the molecular studies that have been developed in the recent past which are localized to the cervix in accordance with the pathophysiology of cervical cancer involving the study of methylation patterns. She then went on to tell us about breast cancer, the current problems faced in the early detection of breast cancer and suggested us to use our strategy involving serum-based detection for the detection of breast cancer biomarkers. When asked about the commonality among her patients, she said her patients were of low socioeconomic status, have poor/no education and have poor standards of living. These women, in her opinion, seems to have apprehensions about participating in a Pap smear test since it is not a pleasant experience even though it is a precancerous screening technique. She also highlighted the social stigma around the test and consequently when patients come to her for diagnosis, they often end up in stage two as a result of their neglect of preventive screening. Finally, she furnished inputs to our project and informed us that districts such as Perambalur and Ariyalur own the highest incidence of cervical cancer. These districts are very near Thanjavur.  She insisted that we obtain stage-specific statistics of cervical cancer from Thanjavur Medical College so that the motivation of our project is bolstered. Overall, it was a very informative and much-needed session for the SASTRA iGEM Team. To be able to talk to a clinician about current diagnostic and treatment methods and also about the disease itself and about our iGEM project was extremely insightful.
