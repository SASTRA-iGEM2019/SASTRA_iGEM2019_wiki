           It was a bustling Monday morning on the Chennai roads. The venue for the grand SynBio Auction was getting ready at a fervent pace. Tumultuous atmosphere prevailed with the setting up of the chairs, tables, desks and scorecards for the auction.  Avid participants of the auction were all geared up and were intensely discussing with their team members to strategize and win. We, the members of the iGEM SASTRA Team had spent a weekâ€™s time crafting the SynBio auction with love for the fraternity of D. A. V. Public School, Velachery. The target audience for the session was the 12th-grade students of Biology and Computer Science streams, who were accompanied by their subject teachers.

           The iGEM SASTRA team in their second outing, conducted the human practices session for the students of class XI and XII at Shri Natesan Vidyasala, Mannivakkam on 20th June 2019. The activity developed for the school students was a grand Synthetic Biology auction, colloquially called the SynBio Auction. The session witnessed the participation of over 200 enthusiastic school students pursuing education in Science streams. An introductory presentation on Synthetic Biology and our current project had the audience engaged. Then, the grand SynBio auction began. The students were divided into 5 teams, led by a teacher for participation in the auction. The phases saw heated bidding for each of the components. The auction went on for nearly an hour and we were surprised to see the participating students maintain a fervent atmosphere throughout. The final stage of the activity involved the teams to consolidate their strategies and justify their choice of components purchased in the course of the auction. Subsequently, the teams were asked to send a member from their team to the center stage to present their solution to the judges within a minute. The curtains finally fell on the second human practice session of our iGEM team with a group photo of the staff, students and the iGEM SASTRA team.

           Our third human practices session was held at Chettinad Vidyashram, Chennai on 21st June 2019. The session was conducted in collaboration with IIT (Indian Institute of Technology) Madras iGEM team. The session witnessed the participation of 250 enthusiastic class XI and XII students from the biology and biotechnology streams, lasting just over 2 hours. We had three separate sessions addressing the different aspects of Synthetic Biology and also made sure that the content was put across in a simplified way for the students to understand. A few cool iGEM project examples were also discussed and these included projects about mimicking the smell of rain in the lab and playing minesweeper with E.coli. This was followed by the members of the IIT Madras team talking about their iGEM project and a small card game called Micropolis. The curtains finally fell on the third human practices session of our team with a group photo along with the IIT Madras iGEM team members.
