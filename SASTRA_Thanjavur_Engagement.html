                 Our first human practices session was for the 12-th grade students of the Biology and Computer Science streams along with their teachers. The introductory session about iGEM and synthetic biology  for 20-25 minutes perked the interest of our beloved audience. We observed excellent interactions between the presenters and the students. A humorous yet memorable anecdote was where Pooja (part of our wet lab team) compared the double looped structures of toehold switches to balloons, setting off a chain of roaring laughter in the crowd. The students were introduced to the SynBio auction and its working. Each team was asked to give themselves a cool team name for easier correspondence later in the auction. Each team was also furnished with the SynBio Auction Handbook, the bible for each team during the course of the auction. The teams were given 20 minutes to go through the rules and regulations of the auction provided in the handbook and were asked to approach the iGEM team members for any clarifications.  In order to engage the audience, we came up with an impromptu solution. The teams could garner extra money (Rs.100) by virtue of a trivia question correctly answered by anyone from the audience. In addition, the audience was given the option to choose to which team they would be providing the money. Each of the phases gave way to intense bidding for each of the components. The auction went on for nearly four hours.The final stage of the activity involved the teams to consolidate their strategies in 15 minutes from the components purchased in the course of the auction.  The teams were asked to send a member from their team to the centre stage to present their solution to the judges in under five minutes.  We were proud to see that the students did an excellent job in pulling off a formidable presentation of their solution and were confident enough to rebut questions from the iGEM team members and the audience. This proved to us that the message of synthetic biology got through to the students.

               The iGEM SASTRA team in their second outing, conducted the human practices session for the students of class XI and XII at Shri Natesan Vidyasala, Mannivakkam on 20th June 2019. The activity developed for the school students was a grand Synthetic Biology auction, colloquially called the SynBio Auction. The session witnessed the participation of over 200 enthusiastic school students pursuing education in Science streams. An introductory presentation on Synthetic Biology and our current project had the audience engaged. Then, the grand SynBio auction began. The students were divided into 5 teams, led by a teacher for participation in the auction. The phases saw heated bidding for each of the components. The auction went on for nearly an hour and we were surprised to see the participating students maintain a fervent atmosphere throughout. The final stage of the activity involved the teams to consolidate their strategies and justify their choice of components purchased in the course of the auction. Subsequently, the teams were asked to send a member from their team to the center stage to present their solution to the judges within a minute. The curtains finally fell on the second human practice session of our iGEM team with a group photo of the staff, students and the iGEM SASTRA team.

               Our third human practices session was held at Chettinad Vidyashram, Chennai on 21st June 2019. The session was conducted in collaboration with IIT (Indian Institute of Technology) Madras iGEM team. The session witnessed the participation of 250 enthusiastic class XI and XII students from the biology and biotechnology streams, lasting just over 2 hours. We had three separate sessions addressing the different aspects of Synthetic Biology and also made sure that the content was put across in a simplified way for the students to understand. A few cool iGEM project examples were also discussed and these included projects about mimicking the smell of rain in the lab and playing minesweeper with E.coli. This was followed by the members of the IIT Madras team talking about their iGEM project and a small card game called Micropolis. The curtains finally fell on the third human practices session of our team with a group photo along with the IIT Madras iGEM team members.
